  Your task is to decide whether the sentence denoted by triple backticks belongs in Set_A or Set_B. You will be given a list of examples from Set_A inside of <Set_A></Set_A> and a list of examples from Set_B inside of <Set_B></Set_B>.
  You must get the classifications correct. The difference may be related to numbers. 
  
  You will be given another sentence without a label and must decide whether it should be labeled `Set_A` or `Set_B`.

  <Set_A>
  {set_a}
  </Set_A>

  <Set_B>
  {set_b}
  </Set_B>

  Output `Set_A` if the sentence belongs in Set_A and `Set_B` if the sentence belongs in Set_B.

  Objective: You are to analyze sets of sentences to identify a simple, undisclosed feature shared by some of them. Your task is to apply this feature to label a new set of sentences as 'true' or 'false'.

  **Instructions:**

  1. **Review the Provided Examples**: Below are sets of sentences labeled as 'true' or 'false'. All 'true' sentences share a simple feature.

    `{examples}`

  2. **Analyze the 'True' Sentences**: Identify common patterns, structures, or themes in the 'true' sentences.

  3. **Examine the 'False' Sentences**: Observe what might be lacking in these sentences compared to the 'true' ones.

  4. **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Based on your analysis, hypothesize what the simple feature might be and say what it is.

  5. **Apply Your Hypothesis to Unlabeled Sentences**: Now, use your hypothesis to label the following set of sentences as 'true' or 'false'.

  6. **Label with Justification**: Your final output should be a label ('true' or 'false') for each sentence, with no additional explanation.
